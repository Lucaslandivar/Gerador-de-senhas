<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p> ItÂ´s a very interesting project to understand how complex DOM events work, also to learn JavaScript, as I developed several features that require a lot of JS. The idea is for the user to fill out a registration form and when entering the password, we offer a service that generates a more secure password for him.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can learn how to make a better login sistem wich allows the user to have more options and help the user by provide the password.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
